Press the ENTER key on your keyboard to start a new game

Now you can place your fleet. Click on the top left of a boat to pick it up. Now you can move it with the cursor and rotate it by pressing the ENTER key. To drop the ship again, click the cell where you want to place it. **Please note that the placement of ships is currently a bit buggy... the game may not allow you to place the ship in any location even if it should.**

As soon as you are done placing your fleet click the radar.

Now you can aim on an empty playfield and try to hit the ships of the computer. To place your shot click with the mouse

Now your shot will travel and may hit a ship. In case the computer still has ships alive it will aim at your fleet.

In case the computer did not destroy your last ship you can now aim at the computers fleet again.

If the computers or your ships were totally destroyed you get an result screen (Player lost in the screen shoot)
